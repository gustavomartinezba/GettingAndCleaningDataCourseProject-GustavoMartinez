# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject-GustavoMartinez
This is my project for the course Getting and Cleaning Data of the John Hopkings University online (Coursera) Data Science specialization. 

The bulk of the work is done by the script run_analysis.R, where the five steps given in the instructions are detailed and performed. Besides, for the sake of readability, two other scripts are sourced to perform tasks which are less relevant to this course:
* get_files.R downloads the file from the url given in the instructions and unzips it in the working directory.
* read_files.R reads, as data frames, the tables needed for the assignment and saves them in the global environment.
